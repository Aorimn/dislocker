INTRODUCTION
`------------

This file describes how to install dislocker onto your machine.



REQUIREMENTS
`------------

You need:
 - Compiler, gcc or clang;
 - make (or gmake, for FreeBSD)
 - Headers for FUSE;
 - Headers for PolarSSL;
 - A partition encrypted with BitLocker, from Windows Vista, 7 or 8.

For Debian-like:
  aptitude install gcc make libfuse-dev libpolarssl-dev
For Fedora-like:
  yum install gcc make fuse-devel polarssl-devel
For FreeBSD:
  pkg install gmake fusefs-libs polarssl
For OSX: Follow the instructions in the next section.

Note that the code expects FUSE 2.6.



INSTALLING
`----------

First thing to do is to cd into the src/ directory. Then, each OS type has its
own section below, beware to follow yours:

. If you are on MacOSX, just install Homebrew (http://brew.sh/) and run the
following command:
$ brew install dislocker.rb
This will install dislocker.

. If you're on FreeBSD, follow the instructions below (next point) by replacing
`make' with `gmake':

. If you aren't on MacOSX...
If you already have installed the dependencies (see REQUIREMENTS section above),
you just have to type `make' to generate the library and binaries, then
`make install' as super-user to install these library and binaries on the
filesystem.

Note that the `-Werror' flag on the `WFLAGS' line in the Makefile may break the
compilation for useless warnings, so you can remove it, but it is at your own
risks.

The binary will be installed into `/usr/bin/' by default, pass the bindir
variable to make to change that in the `make install` command. This would do
something like `make install bindir=/home/blah/compile/bin/`
Same thing goes for the library except the variable name is libdir, which is
`/usr/lib/' by default (or `/usr/lib64/' if it exists).
Note that you can also pass DESTDIR or prefix in order to change the default
installation directories at once.

Once installed, see dislocker(1) for details on how to use it.



UNINSTALLING
`------------

I'm sure you don't want to do that. But if you're really forced by someone, just
type `make uninstall` as super-user.



PORTABILITY
`-----------

Globally, this was successfuly tested on Linux x86/x86_64, MacOSX and FreeBSD.
It won't work on Windows and may not work on other BSDs. For Ubuntu 10.04,
you'll need to remove the `-Werror' flag from the WFLAGS variable in the
Makefile.

For MacOSX, it has been tested against OSXFUSE 2.3.8 and 2.3.9.

For users of a gcc version < 4.3, you'll need to tweak the Makefile a little by
removing `-Werror' from the WFLAGS variable.


Whether it works or not, feel free to send comments and feedbacks to

NOTE
`----

Four binaries are built when compiling dislocker as described in the INSTALLING
section:
- One for disecting a .bek file and printing information about it
  dislocker-bek
- Another one for printing information about a BitLocker-encrypted volume
  dislocker-metadata
- A third one for decrypting a BitLocker encrypted partition into a flat file
formatted as an NTFS partition you can mount
  dislocker-file
- A last one, which is the one you're using when calling `dislocker',
dynamically decrypts a BitLocker encrypted partition using FUSE
  dislocker-fuse


You can build each one independently providing it as the makefile target. For
instance, if you want to compile dislocker-fuse only, you'd simply run:
  make dislocker-fuse
To install this binary only, you would then run the following command:
  make install BINS=dislocker-fuse
