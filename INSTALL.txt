INTRODUCTION
`------------

This file describes how to install dislocker onto your machine.



REQUIREMENTS
`------------

You need:
 - Headers for FUSE;
 - Headers for PolarSSL;
 - A partition encrypted with BitLocker, from Windows Vista, 7 or 8.

For Debian-like:
  aptitude install libfuse-dev libmbedtls-dev
For Fedora-like:
  yum install fuse-devel mbedtls-devel
For OSX: Follow the instructions in the next section.

Of course, you also need a compiler like gcc or clang, and make.

Note that the code expects FUSE 2.6.



INSTALLING
`----------

First thing to do is to cd into the src/ directory. Then, each OS type has its
own section below, beware to follow yours:

. If you are on MacOSX, just install Homebrew (http://brew.sh/) and run the
following command:
$ brew install dislocker.rb
This will install dislocker.

. If you're on FreeBSD, run the following commands for installing the required
libraries:
$ pkg install mbedtls gmake fusefs-libs
Then follow the instructions below (next point) by replacing `make' with
`gmake':

. If you aren't on MacOSX...
If you already have installed the dependencies (see REQUIREMENTS section above),
you just have to type `make' to generate the library and binaries, then
`make install' as super-user to install these library and binaries on the
filesystem.

Note that the `-Werror' flag on the `WFLAGS' line in the Makefile may break the
compilation, so you can remove it, but it is at your own risks.

The binary will be installed into `/usr/bin/' by default, edit the INSTALL_PATH
variable (into the Makefile) to change that before the `make install` command.
Same thing goes for the library except the variable name in the Makefile is
LIBRARY_PATH, which is `/usr/lib/' by default (or `/usr/lib64/' if it exists).

Once installed, see dislocker(1) for details on how to use it.



UNINSTALLING
`------------

I'm sure you don't want to do that. But if you're really forced by someone, just
type `make uninstall` as super-user.



PORTABILITY
`-----------

Globally, this was successfuly tested on Linux x86/x86_64, MacOSX and FreeBSD.
It won't work on Windows and may not work on other BSDs.

For MacOSX, it has been tested against OSXFUSE 2.3.8 and 2.3.9.

For users of a gcc version < 4.3, you'll need to tweak the Makefile a little by
removing `-Werror' from the WFLAGS variable.


Whether it works or not, feel free to send comments and feedbacks to

NOTE
`----

Four binaries are built when compiling dislocker as described in the INSTALLING
section:
- One for disecting a .bek file and printing information about it
  dislocker-bek
- Another one for printing information about a BitLocker-encrypted volume
  dislocker-metadata
- A third one for decrypting a BitLocker encrypted partition into a flat file
formatted as an NTFS partition you can mount
  dislocker-file
- A last one, which is the one you're using when calling `dislocker',
dynamically decrypts a BitLocker encrypted partition using FUSE
  dislocker-fuse


You can build each one independently providing it as the makefile target. For
instance, if you want to compile dislocker-fuse only, you'd simply run:
  make dislocker-fuse
To install this binary only, you would then run the following command:
  make install BINS=dislocker-fuse
