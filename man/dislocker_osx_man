.SH NAME
Dislocker - Read BitLocker encrypted volumes under Linux
.SH SYNOPSIS
dislocker [-hqrv] [-l \fILOG_FILE\fR] [-o \fIOFFSET\fR] [-V \fIVOLUME\fR \fIDECRYPTMETHOD\fR -F[\fIN\fR]] [-- \fIARGS\fR...]

Where DECRYPTMETHOD = {-p[\fIRECOVERY_PASSWORD\fR] | -f \fIBEK_FILE\fR |-u[\fIUSER_PASSWORD\fR] | -k \fIFVEK_FILE\fR | -c}
.SH DESCRIPTION
Given a decryption mean, dislocker is used to read BitLocker encrypted volumes.
Note that decryption of USB volumes is not available yet.
.PP
Options are described below:
.PP
.TP
.B -c, --clearkey
decrypt volume using a clear key which is search on the volume
.TP
.B -f, --bekfile \fIBEK_FILE\fR
decrypt volume using the bek file (present on a USB key)
.TP
.B -F, --force-block[\fIN\fB]\fR
force use of metadata block number
.B N
(1, 2 or 3), the first by default
.TP
.B -h
print the help and exit
.TP
.B -k, --fvek \fIFVEK_FILE\fR
decrypt volume using the FVEK directly.
See the FVEK FILE section below to understand what is to be put into this \fIFVEK_FILE\fR
.TP
.B -l, --logfile \fILOG_FILE\fR
put messages into this file (stdout by default)
.TP
.B -o, --offset \fIOFFSET\fR
BitLocker partition offset in base 10 (default is 0).
Protip: in your shell, you probably can pass \fB-o $((\fI0xdeadbeef\fB))\fR if you have a 16-based number and are too lazy to convert it in another way.
.TP
.B -p, --recovery-password[\fIRECOVERY_PASSWORD\fB]\fR
decrypt volume using the recovery password method.
If no password is provided, it will be asked afterward; this has the advantage that the program will validate each block one by one, on the fly, as you type it
.TP
.B -q, --quiet
do NOT display any information.
This option has priority on any `\fB-v\fR'. One probably wants to check the return value of the program when using this option
.TP
.B -r, --readonly
do not allow to write on the BitLocker volume (read only mode)
.TP
.B -u, --user-password
decrypt the volume using the user password method
.TP
.B -v, --verbosity
increase verbosity (verbosity to CRITICAL level by default), see also `\fB-q\fR'
.TP
.B -V, --volume \fIVOLUME\fR
volume to get metadata and encrypted keys from
.TP
.B --
mark the end of program's options and the beginning of FUSE's ones (useful if you want to pass something like -d to FUSE)
.PP

.B ARGS
are any arguments you want to pass to FUSE. Note that you need to pass at least the mount-point.
.PP
A second mode is available besides FUSE: don't use FUSE, decrypt the entire volume into a new file.
After using this mode, just mount the resulting file normally afterward.
This process may take a very long time, depending on the initial volume size.
.SH NOTES
There are two decryption modes available: FILE or FUSE.
One of them is \fBchosen during the compilation time\fR.
.PP
In FILE mode, the BitLocker volume is decrypted into a file.
This mode require a huge amount of time for a huge volume, but the access of the decrypted volume afterward will be faster than with the FUSE mode as the decrypted file can be assimilated as any NTFS volume.
.PP
In FUSE mode, the NTFS "file" is decrypted according to the data asked for by a user.
So each request for a piece of data will take the time to decrypt these data.
There is no impact on the final user if only "small" piece of data are asked.
.SH FVEK FILE
.TP
The FVEK file option expects a specific format from the file. The file is split into two major parts:
- 2 bytes describing the encryption in use, from 0x8000 to 0x8003 for AES 128 or 256 bits, with or without diffuser.

- 64 bytes (512 bits) which are the FVEK as in the FVEK key protector once decrypted.
.PP
The file is therefore 66 bytes long, not more nor less.
.SH EXAMPLES
These are exemples you can run directly.
First, you may want to copy the BitLocker volume:
.P
.B % dd if=/dev/sda2 of=encrypted.bitlocker
.P
This will copy the entire volume located into \fB/dev/sda2\fR to \fBencrypted.bitlocker\fR.
.P
Then dislock it:
.IP
-- In `file' mode:
.IP
.B % dislocker -V encrypted.bitlocker -p563200-557084-108284-218900-019151-415437-694144-239976 -- decrypted.ntfs
.IP
This will decrypt \fBencrypted.bitlocker\fR into \fBdecrypted.ntfs\fR using the recovery password method.
.IP
-- In `FUSE' mode:
.IP
.B % dislocker -V encrypted.bitlocker -f /path/to/usb/file.BEK -- /mnt/ntfs
.IP
This will create a file into \fB/mnt/ntfs\fR named dislocker-file.
.TP
To mount partitions once decrypted, you first need to create the block device:
.B % hdiutil attach -imagekey diskimage-class=CRawDiskImage -nomount ntfs/dislocker-file
.TP
Then mount it on a file into /Volumes for instance:
.B % mkdir /Volumes/blah && mount -t ntfs /dev/disk1 /Volumes/blah
.P
--
.TP
It seems that you have to unmount the NTFS partition and the dislocker one before halting the system, or you will run into unexpected behaviour. In order to do so, you may run these commands (replacing your mount points):
.B % umount /mnt/clear && umount /mnt/ntfs/dislocker-file
.P
--
.P
Note that these are \fBexamples\fR and, as such, you may need to modify the given command lines. For example, you may want to change the decryption method used in them.
